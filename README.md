This is an Arduio mock library that worked in visual studio for program,debug and test your Arduino application instead of directly using your hardware.
this library will save you a lot of time due to no need to download your code to flash and you can use VS debugger to debug your program.
I highly used main Arduino library and just port hardware part to VS library.

Printf library print in Console to imitate serial port
FS library create file on project directory to imitate flash 

insert your code to ino.cpp file
